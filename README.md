# Arborist
Arborist is a node based application to print out the author's favourite tree.  It is built using Express, and uses Jest for tests.

## Development
Arborist can be developed in two ways:

- For traditional "local" development, a development container configuration has been included.  When the folder is loaded into VS Code, a prompt will be visible asking the user if they would like to run the project in a container, clicking "Run in container" will build the project's container alongside helpful development utilities.
- For development against a more "production-like" environment, Kubernetes manifests will be included for each environment under the `.k8s` folder.

## Tests
Testing is handled by [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [Supertest](https://github.com/ladjs/supertest), and test reports can be generated by running:
```
npm test
```

Tests are kept within the `__tests__` folder, and the structure of this folder should match the folder structure of the application.  As an example, for a file located at `/foo/bar.js`, a corresponding test file would be located at `/__tests__/foo/bar.test.js`.
